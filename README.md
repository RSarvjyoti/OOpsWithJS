# OOpsWithJS
## OOps : -
- Inheritance
  1. Multiple Inheritance (not possible)
  2. Multilevel Inheritance
- Encapsulation : Encapsulation is about bundling data (properties) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.
- Abtraction : Abstraction hides the implementation details from the user and only exposes essential functionalities.
- Polymorphism : Polymorphism allows the same method to behave differently based on the object or subclass that calls it.


# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

| **OOP Concept**   | **Description**                                | **Implementation**        |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Inheritance**    | One class inherits properties/methods         | `extends`                |
| **Encapsulation**  | Hiding details using private properties       | `#privateField`          |
| **Abstraction**    | Exposing essential methods, hiding details    | Abstract base class      |
| **Polymorphism**   | Same method behaves differently for subclasses| Method overriding        |
